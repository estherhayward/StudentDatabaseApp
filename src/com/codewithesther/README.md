#Student Database App

## What this project is about
The aim was to build an application that manages student enrollments and their tuition balance using object oriented principles in Java.

## User stories
- Ask the user how many new students will be added to the database
- The user should be prompted to enter the name and year for each student
- The student should have a 5-digit unique ID, with the first number being their grade level
- A student can enroll in different courses
- Each course costs $600 to enroll
- The student should be able to view their balance and pay the tuition
- To see the status of the student, we should see their name, ID, courses enrolled, and balance

## Goal
- To practice for myself
- Apply OOP principles

## To do
- Apply exception handling
